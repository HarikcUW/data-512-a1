# Project goal: 
Construct, Analyze and publish a dataset of monthly traffic (page views) on English Wikipedia and make it fully reproducible using best practices for open scientific research.
A page view is a request for the content of a web page and we are using count of page views delivered to users. You can find more details @ https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Page_view

# Data and API Dcouments:
Source data: Analytics/Data Lake/Traffic/Pageview hourly - Wikitech (wikimedia.org)
https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/AQS/Legacy_Pagecounts

* Wikipedia page traffic is available to public using [Wikimedia REST API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_REST_API)
   * Data is available from December 2007, and exposed using 2 APIs. Refer API end points listed below for get API format, parameters and how to access.
   * Legacy Page counts API:
        * Documentation: [Analytics/AQS/Legacy Pagecounts](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/AQS/Legacy_Pagecounts)
        * API endpoint:[Wikimedia REST API-Legacy Pagecounts](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#/Pagecounts_data_(legacy)/get_metrics_legacy_pagecounts_aggregate_project_access_site_granularity_start_end)
        * Data availability: December 2007 to July 2016
   * Pageviews API: 
        * Documentation: [Analytics/AQS/Pageviews](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/AQS/Pageviews)
        * API endpoint: [Wikimedia REST API-Pageviews](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#/Pageviews_data/get_metrics_pageviews_aggregate_project_access_agent_granularity_start_end)
        * Data availability:July 2015 to last month

Some key attributes from source data:
  * timestamp: UTC timestamp of the request
  * project  : Project name from requests hostname
  * access_method: Method used to access the pages, can be desktop, mobile web, or mobile app or request was to the "mobile" site or the "desktop" site, or an "app" request
  * agent_type: Agent accessing the pages, can be spider,  user or automated
  * view_count: number of pageviews
  * year : Unpadded year (from timestamp) of pageviews
  * month: Unpadded month (from timestamp) of pageviews

# Final data file details:
* Data file location:data-512-a1/data-final/
* File name: en-wikipedia_traffic_200712-202108.csv
* File format: Tab delimited csv file
* Attributes List:
    * Final dataset has Year, Month and 6 metrics related to page views.
    * year : Year of page view request UTC timestamp
    * Month: Month of page view request UTC timestamp
    * pagecount_all_views: Total page counts using desktop or mobile access methods. It is calculated using sum of pagecount_desktop_views and pagecount_mobile_views. Metric from Legacy API.
    * pagecount_desktop_views: Total page counts requested using desktop. Metric from Legacy API. 
    * pagecount_mobile_views: Total page counts requested using mobile. Metric from Legacy API.
    * pageview_all_views: Total page counts using desktop or mobile access methods. It is calculated using sum of pageview_desktop_views and pageview_mobile_views.
    * pageview_desktop_views: Total page counts requested using desktop. Metric from Legacy API
    * pageview_mobile_views: Total page counts requested using desktop. Metric from Legacy API

# Known Issues:
  * Edits are not counted in page views, because it might be already counted when user initially clicked/opened that page, Also it should not be included as part of consumption metrics, it will fall under production metric.
  * Legacy Pagecounts are sampled web request logs whereas current Pageviews are un-sampled web request logs. 
  * Legacy Pagecount definition is several years old, so it might be less accurate. Also the new definition evolved over time as new ways of viewing content are developed (e.g. a mobile app using and APIs)
  * Current Pageviews definition makes a better effort at counting traffic from real persons and excluding automation
  * Current Pageviews definition detects and flags more spiders (which can be a significant fraction of total traffic on some wikis) and provides option to count traffic from real persons and excluding automation, data from Pagecounts API doesnâ€™t exclude. That why we may observe high volume in Legacy Pagecounts compare to Pageviews though recent traffic is much higher than earlier. 
  * Legacy Pageviews data excludes data from apps 
  * Latest technologies help to improve quality & efficiency, so the Pageviews might be more accurate compare to Pagecounts. The new definition is generated on the analytics cluster using Hadoop and web request logs and the previous definition relied on a tool named webstatscollector: Analytics/Webstatscollector
  * Legacy Pagecounts data refresh was stopped in 2016, so any issues found in data/calculation after that are used to refresh only Pageviews data set.
